# PlatformIO Setup

PlatformIO is a framework used for development. It simplifies dependency management, building, CI/CD, programming and more. 

We recommend that you use VSCode as editor, since it provides excellent support with PlatformIO.

## Installation

1. Installing PlatformIO is incredibely simple. In VSCode click the extensions button on the toolbar on the lefthand side. 
- In case there is none press `CTRL+SHIFT+p` and type: "ext install".
2. In the extensions manager search for "PlatformIO IDE" and click on "Install"
3. Wait for the installation to finish and restart VSCode.
4. A new toolbar button should have appeared and a welcome screen should open.

Installation is now complete and you can continue using PlatformIO.
